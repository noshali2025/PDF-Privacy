  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Arriverr PDF Reader</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “Arriverr”) operates the <a href="https://arriverr.com">https://arriverr.com</a> website and the Arriverr PDF Reader mobile application (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use the App.</p>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 29, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>Arriverr PDF Reader is a productivity/utility application for viewing, scanning and editing PDF documents. The App includes features such as Text→PDF, PDF→Image (including long images), Scan→PDF, Compress PDF, Lock/Unlock PDF, Split & Merge PDF, HTML→PDF and PDF editing tools. The App displays advertisements and may offer optional premium features or cloud backup features.</p>

  <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
  <p>We distinguish between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data you provide directly:</strong> We do not require account creation or login to use the App. If you contact us (for support or deletion requests) we will collect the contact information you provide (for example, your email address if you email <code>support@arriverr.com</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Data collected automatically:</strong> When you use the App, we or our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage for analytics, ads, and diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Files you open or edit:</strong> PDF files and images that you open or process are by default processed locally on your device. We do not upload your documents to our servers except where you explicitly choose an optional cloud/backup feature (for example, Google Drive backup) — and only after you explicitly grant the App the required permission.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Automatically collected data (examples)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (advertising ID, device model, OS version)</li>
    <li>Crash and diagnostic data (logs, stack traces)</li>
    <li>App usage data (which features are used, session times)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (only if required by an ad provider to serve relevant ads; we do not collect precise GPS location unless you explicitly grant that permission for a specific feature)</li>
    <li>Network information (IP address for basic networking and ads)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Your PDFs and images are processed on your device by default. We do not access or store your documents unless you explicitly use a cloud backup or share option that uploads files.
  </div>

  <h2>3. Why we collect data (purposes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display and personalize advertisements in the App.</li>
    <li>To diagnose and fix crashes or performance issues and improve the App.</li>
    <li>To provide optional cloud backup features if you choose to connect to a cloud service.</li>
    <li>To respond to user support requests (for example, via <code>support@arriverr.com</code>).</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-party services and advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party service providers for analytics, crash reporting, ads, and other services. These providers may collect or process data as described above. Common providers used by apps with similar functionality include advertising and analytics services such as Google (AdMob, Google Analytics for Firebase), and other ad/analytics partners. If you use the App with advertising enabled, ad networks may collect device identifiers and non-personal information to deliver and personalize ads.</p>

  <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party services used by the App to learn how they manage data.</p>

  <h2>5. User accounts and authentication</h2>
  <p>The App does not require or support account creation for normal use. If you choose to connect to a cloud backup provider (for example Google Drive) the cloud provider’s account system will handle authentication and permissions. We do not manage or store your cloud account credentials.</p>

  <h2>6. Data security and encryption</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data in our custody. Data transmitted between your device and third-party services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure — if you have special security needs, please contact us at <code>support@arriverr.com</code>.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is a general productivity utility and is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in applicable jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under applicable age limits. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

  <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain user support communications and any data required for legal or business purposes only as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law. Diagnostic and analytics data are retained by us or by third-party providers in accordance with their policies. If you request deletion (see below), we will respond as described in the "Your rights" section.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
  <p><strong>Data deletion / access:</strong> You may request access to or deletion of the personal data we hold about you. To make such a request, please contact us at <code>support@arriverr.com</code> with a clear subject such as “Data deletion request”. We will verify your request to the extent reasonably necessary and respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <p><strong>Advertising choices:</strong> If you wish to opt out of personalized advertising, you can change ad personalization settings on your device (for example via OS-level ad settings or by resetting your advertising ID). You can also consult the privacy controls of the ad networks and analytics providers used by the App.</p>

  <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Because our services and third-party providers may be located in different countries, data collected may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. We will take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate safeguards for such transfers, such as relying on the data protection practices of our service providers.</p>

  <h2>11. Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, we rely on several legal bases to process personal data, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consent (for certain optional features or where required),</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests (for analytics, app improvement, and advertising), and</li>
    <li>Performance of a contract or to comply with legal obligations as applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12. California consumers (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
  <p>If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and related laws. These rights may include the right to request access to personal information, deletion, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information (note: targeted advertising may be considered a form of sale under certain definitions). To exercise these rights, please contact us at <code>support@arriverr.com</code>.</p>

  <h2>13. Links to other sites</h2>
  <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. Before providing personal information on a third-party site, review their privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>14. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the Effective Date above. We recommend that you review this page periodically for the latest information.</p>

  <h2>15. Contact us</h2>
